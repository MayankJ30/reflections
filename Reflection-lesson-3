When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When more thaan one person is working on a project or if you want a data backup of some valubale project 
  to fall back upon in case of data failure locally. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
	Because if you're working on a feature, you might not want to mess it up by Git autmatically pulling
	from GitHub where someone else in your team might have made a change. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	You fork someone else's repository within the GitHub paradigm. It has no meaning outside of GitHub.
	You make a branch in your OWN repository as a means to add some new features without disturbing production 
	code.
	You clone any repository that is remote or on your own machine. This creates a copy of that repository.
